I remember the ~possibility of anonymous vision, and it was within
that I wanted to love them.

That world's gone. Here, today, I was hoping to find some work.

There's a mine not far from here. Mention my name to sub foreman Chad.

Thanks __. Whoever and whatever sees us like this, in this daylight,
will see you're a true friend to me.

And whoever sees me you.

(can't remember first verse)

The LED once eyed
Vowed to be forever the bride
On a graph laid down inside
An infra that silently spied
Of a seeker who barely tried

Lips as limit flash askew
When swearing the network's concave
Disclosing a real I'd not rue
A palm my palm would crave

The LED once eyed...

****

A tree doctor
A salesman

animalistically, begins devouring a spongy food.

Brother, can I have some food?

Sub-foreman Chad hates sharing.

You give a fuck what sub-foreman Chad thinks?

You never know he could see you say that, or someone could and tell him.

Someone moral could be watching, today or some day after. Someone good.
They'd see you do good and say you were good.

No, I don't think. But God. Here.

You're looking for someone.
