Is it so that poetry's area of effect has shrunk drastically? Duh that the mathematization
of scientific knowledge wrested the efficacy of cosmic pronouncements from the poem. Duh
that the emergence of propaganda undercut the desirability or even comprehension of the poet
in the minds of Earthly powers. Duh that the commercialization of religion descoped another
source of poetry's claim to cosmic veracity. Duh that the marketization of mass entertainment
cast poetry into the role of only the weakest product category in the tireless struggle
for social attention. Duh, perhaps, that social media made a mockery of poetry's claim as
a unique vehicle for the realization of new, cliche shattering language.

Duh most of all that memory, supported once by the prosodic mneumonics of poetry's art, has
atrophied and collapsed given the opportunity to consult searchable electronic records.

Does anything remain?

Reading (in Speech and Language Processing) about entropy in the
information theoretic sense of the word, and I thought this was
an interesting way of thinking about obscurity in poetry. A signal can
be transmitted error free if the entropy of the signal (the irreducible
complexity below which the signal can not be compressed) is less than
the channel capacity. Well semanticity is not (I think) reducible to
information so this relationship I am drawing is more metaphoric than
real but I find it provocative and useful to think of obscurity in
poetry as squeezing the channel capacity so that the signal becomes
prey to the channel's noise. Or maybe even more usefully as ramping up
the entropy of the signal to exceed the channel's capacity.

The deep relationship between blindness and poetry, even for instance
in the simulated blindness of the young bards at the Gaelic poetry
school who worked in darkness, against the Baudelairean visionary
apprehension of the (imperial-consumerist) real. Look up Benjamin.
